# PWA Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Progressive Web App:

- `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixels PNG icon
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixels PNG icon

These icons are referenced in `manifest.json` and used by the service worker for push notifications.

To create icons:
1. Design a square icon (192x192 and 512x512)
2. Save as PNG files with the names above
3. Place them in this directory

The icons should represent the Dragnet Intelematics branding.
